# Interview Analysis based on the video

This document provides an overview of the Interview Analysis Module developed to evaluate candidatesâ€™ performance during interviews. The module seamlessly processes interview videos, extracts and analyzes relevant data, and generates contextual summaries using advanced AI techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs).






## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vaghani04/Module_2.git
```

Add video interview in `.\data\raw\<video_interview_name>`

Install all the dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```

run the `main.py` from `.\scripts`

```bash
  python .\scripts\main.py
```

Now you can see all summaries in the `.\outputs` directory
