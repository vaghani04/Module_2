 I've been worried for a lot of a Cassandra for quite a while. Where people would think it's about AI. They're like, what are you talking about? They've never had any experience with AI. The most in technology, I have been a person in technology for a long time, I could see it coming. So, there's been a number of breakthroughs. Someone can see a dynamically created of themselves, 30 correctivity of you saying anything in real time. Or me. And so, the deep-pick videos, which are really incredibly good, in fact sometimes, were convincing them real ones. Deep real. And obviously, things like charge GBT were one, GPD2, GPD3, GPD4, the whole sort of lead up to that. So, it was easy for me to, going, if you just sort of, to replicate the points on a curve, and I see that trend will continue, then we will have profound artificial intelligence. And obviously, at a level that far exceeds human intelligence. So, at this point that people are taking seriously, and I'd like to say thank you for holding this AI safety conference. I think actually it will go down in history as being very important. I think it's really quite profound. And I do think overall that the potential is therefore artificial intelligence AI to have most likely a positive effect, and to create a future of abundance. To be of goods and services. But somewhat of the magic genie problem, where if you have a magic genie that can grant all the wishes, is don't end well. Be careful what you wish for, including wishes. Great, and people enjoyed having you there today, and doing a job, and something that could be bad. And we do that if we develop the capability models before they are, no cars should be doing. It is good for government to play a role when the safety is at risk. So, majority of software, if the FD is not at risk, I mean if the app crashes on your phone or laptop, it's not a massive catastrophe. But when you're talking about digital super intelligence, I think, which does pose a risk to the public, then there is a role for government to play to safeguard the interests of the public. And this is of course true in many fields, aviation cars. I do what regulators throughout the world want because of installing big communications, rockets, being aerospace, and cars being transports. So, I'm very familiar with dealing with regulators, and I actually agree with the vast majority of regulations. There's a few that I disagree with from time to time, but 0.1% probably. Well, less than 1% of regulations I disagree with. So, from people in Silicon Valley who have never dealt with regulators before, and they think that this is going to just crush innovation and slow them down and be annoying. They're not wrong about that. But we've learnt over the years that having a referee is a good thing. And if you look at any sports game, there's always a referee, and he's suggesting I think to have a sports game without one. And I think that's the right way to think about this is for government to be a referee to make sure that the sportsman like conduct and that the public safety is addressed, that we care about public safety. Because I think there might be at times too much optimism, but I say that as it is. I mean, so I ought to know. And on balance, I think that the AI will be a forceful, likely. But the probability of it going bad is not 0%. So we just need to mitigate the downside. Which marking the road we've been instituted is they hang on, say I'm not people doing luck, capable enough, given how quickly the technology takes care of we do do it quick enough. It's a great point you're making. The pace of AI is any technology I've seen in history by far. And it's through growing in capability by at least five full, perhaps ten full per year. Certainly grow by an order of magnitude next year. Yeah. And government isn't used to moving at that speed. I think even if there are not firm regulations, even if there isn't an enforcement capability site, and being able to concerns the public will be very powerful. So all that's accomplished, I think that will be very, very good. Okay, we can do better than that. And technology laws law, upload days talking one who's doing it fat, because it compounded hardware and entering the personnel. Yeah. Who, currently the two leading centers for AI development are the San Francisco Bay area and the London area. And there are many other places where it's being done, but those are the two leading areas. I think if the United States and the UK and China are sort of aligned on safety, that's all going to be a good thing. That's really, that's where the leadership is. About it, the thing to have done. China is not on board with AI-Safe somewhat of a mood situation. There's a big objection that I get to in kind of AI-regulated safety controls. We'll try to start going to do it, and therefore they will just jump into the lead and exceed us all. But is willing to to spate in AI safety. And thank you for inviting them. And they, you know, I think we should thank China for attending. When I was in China earlier this year, the main subject of discussion with this leadership in China was AI safety. And saying that this is really something that they should care about. And you are too, which is great. And having them here I think was essential. If they're not, what is it? We need everyone away if we're going to have a proponent of making some rhythms public in innovation, and what we're going to do. Source algorithms and data tend to lag next to 12 months. But given the rate of improvement, that there's actually quite a big difference between the course and the open. If things are improving by a factor of 35 or more than being a year behind is your five times worse. So it's a pretty big difference. And that might be actually an okay situation. Suddenly we'll get to the point where you've got open source AI that can do that that will start to approach human level intelligence will perhaps exceed it. I don't know. I think it's somewhat inevitable. There'll be some amount of open source. And I, I guess I would have a slight bias towards open source. You can see what's going on. It was closed source. You don't know what's going on. Not bad with AI that even if it's open, you actually know what's going on because if you've got a gigantic data file and you know sort of billions of data points or weights and parameters, you can't just read it and see what it's going to do. It's a gigantic file of inscrutable numbers. So when you run it, you can test it. You have to see what it's going to do. But it's probabilistic as opposed to, it's not like traditional programming where you've got it. You've got very discrete logic and the outcome is very predictable and you can see what each line's going to do. And neural net is just a whole bunch of probabilities. It sort of ends up being a giant comma separated value file. It's like our digital guide is a CSP file, really? Okay. But that's kind of what it is. It's one that we have been talking about the station, the people who are developing their technologists made an output improving an improve. We'd come out the other, that when you've done before the model understand this new iteration, it brought about in terms of that you are known for being such a brilliant technology. We've talked to people at jobs, have a job or a job. Now, actually AI is already in jobs and it's being used as a new job. Now, which is a good thing, technological or a change in the labor market. We study today that they did a couple of people some of the jobs, some hard-free training people at any point in their career. If we didn't get the other people to keep up with the change and have a good vision be on AI and the impact on labor markets and people about that. Is they think about this? Being the most disruptive force in history here. You know, where we have for the first time, we will have for smarter than the smartest human. And that, I mean, I have to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed. You can have a job if you want to have a job for sort of personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything. So, I don't know if that makes people comfortable on push for a magic geneing. There's no limit. You don't have those three limits, three what you yourself many wishes you want. So, it's good and bad. One of the challenges is how do we find meaning in life if you have a magic geneing that can do everything you want? When this new technology tends to have usually followed an SCOV, in this case we're going to be on the exponential portion of the SCOV for a long time. And we have to actually be able to ask to income, we'll have universal high income. It tends to be somewhat of a leveler when equalizer. Because really, I think everyone wants this magic geney. Anyway, to add, it would be good for education, it would be the best tutor, and the most patient tutor. And no shortage of goods and services will be in age of abundance. I think if people read in banks, the banks, culture books are probably the best in visioning. In fact, not probably, they're definitely by far the best in visioning of an AI future. There's nothing even close. So I'd really recommend banks, a very big fan. All these books are good. There's not say which one, all of them. So, that's, I'll give you a sense of what is a, I guess, a fairly utopian or protopian future with AI. Actually, it can then be the gift you meet. It gives people purpose in their lives. And if you then remove a large chunk of that, what does that mean? And where do you get that for hours? As I was mentioning, when we were to work, it was just somewhat engaging, deliberate suspension of disbelief. Because I'm putting so much blood sweat and tears into a work project and burning the 3 a.m. oil. Then, I'm like, why am I doing this? I can get AI myself another reason. It must be a gladden for a punishment, it's only. So... It's a platform that we care about very, I think, now and then. A lot about change, you get, as we've seen. Yeah. A lot of jobs that are unconscious, sort of, yes. And the computer will have no problem doing that. They're happy to do that all day long. So, I want to cook food, but I want to wash the dishes. And like, the computer is perfectly happy to wash dishes. We still have, like, this compete in the Olympics. And obviously, a machine can compete, but we still have the AC each other. And have AC each other where, even though the machines are better, there's still, I guess, a computer and it's something. And people do for a good example of how, even when we're here, the best human. Yeah. We're developing an old patient. And I think this has to talk about learning. But learning is incredible compared to classroom learning. If you can have it, I'll have a personal tutor specifically them over time. Well, what are they excited about? AI tutors are going to be amazing. But you see them odd, because how can the computer really be your friend? But if you're an AI that has memory, you know, and it's all of your interactions, and has read, like, give it permission to read everything you've ever done, really, we'll know you're better than anyone, perhaps even yourself. And where you can talk to us both upon each other. We have a great friend to endorse us on that thing. And we've had some baking friends, actually. And I was like, well, you know, he, an AI friend would actually be a great friend. Yeah. We live a, anyway, now doing far digitally and by telephone to people. And it's making a world in which actually, you know, I can provide the benefit to people. We should open it up to everyone. Who you learn to do it to, then behind that, why do you think that is a better way to do that? Yeah. Of course. Then they have, inevitably, in control of information. So then the idea behind, well, how do we, how does this driven an approach to truth? How do we, how do we make things the least amount untrue, be more truthful? Delete and untrue for the following reasons. And you can see, where, with the day into a community note, and you can independently create that community, you can actually house this thing of the system, improvements, which is, I think, to be shown greed must agree here. So there's, well, pop-ass around to community notes, and then, play these associated with 100 vectors, that, that, because things are more complicated than something right or left. And, and do sort of, like, okay, these, about the note. Okay, so then that. So then note credibility. Okay. No. Looking quite well. Yeah. Be present for more than a few hours. It average is extremely, or, they're just like send me one. And then, like, is to inform and entertain the public. Uh, possible, um, make the truth. You know, always like the truth. They're true to the truth. Then, I think we'll find that people, uh, you still learn what is going on and to let the truth pace. So I think it will be what, what religion, then, um, this might move. Yeah.
